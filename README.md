# PyBer-Analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data

Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Merge your DataFrames.
Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
The total number of rides for each city type.
Findings:
If we compare the average number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4 and 3.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
The average fares for each city type.
The total number of drivers for each city type.
Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:

The number of rides for each city type.
Findings:
There is one outlier in the urban ride count data. Also, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The fares for each city type.
Findings:
From the combined box-and-whisker plots, we see that there are no outliers. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively. Why do you think there is such a big difference? By looking at the number of riders for each city, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?

The number of drivers for each city type.
Findings:
The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively. By looking at the driver count data and fare data, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?

Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
The percent of total fares.
The percent of total rides.
The percent of total drivers.
